# 💻 Operating Systems : FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Project Overview
This is a standalone, web-based interactive animation and simulation tool designed to visualize the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling** algorithm. The tool allows users to input custom process parameters and observe the real-time, step-by-step execution of the scheduling logic.

## Technology Stack and Specifications
* [cite_start]**Technology Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and Canvas API for animations[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Deployment:** Standalone web application that runs locally in any modern browser[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Dependencies:** Zero server-side dependencies; completely client-side implementation[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Compatibility:** Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) through web browsers[cite: 13].

## Core Functionality and Features
* [cite_start]**Interactive Input:** Interface for customizing processes by defining their **Arrival Time (AT)** and **Burst Time (BT)**[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Step-by-Step Control:** Full animation control with Play, Pause, Step-Forward, and Step-Backward buttons[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Real-time Visualization:** The Canvas API is used to draw a dynamic, color-coded **Gantt Chart** and display the current **Ready Queue**[cite: 18, 49].
* [cite_start]**Customization:** Configurable animation speed via a slider[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Statistics Display:** Real-time display of key metrics, including Current Time, Average Waiting Time, and Average Turnaround Time[cite: 19, 50].
* [cite_start]**Export:** Functionality for exporting screenshots of the execution trace[cite: 20].
