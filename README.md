# 💻 Operating Systems : FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Project Overview
This is a standalone, web-based interactive animation and simulation tool designed to visualize the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling** algorithm. The tool allows users to input custom process parameters and observe the real-time, step-by-step execution of the scheduling logic.

## Technology Stack and Specifications
**Technology Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and Canvas API for animations.
**Deployment:** Standalone web application that runs locally in any modern browser.
**Dependencies:** Zero server-side dependencies; completely client-side implementation.
**Compatibility:** Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) through web browser.

## Core Functionality and Features
**Interactive Input:** Interface for customizing processes by defining their **Arrival Time (AT)** and **Burst Time (BT)**.
**Step-by-Step Control:** Full animation control with Play, Pause, Step-Forward, and Step-Backward buttons.
**Real-time Visualization:** The Canvas API is used to draw a dynamic, color-coded **Gantt Chart** and display the current **Ready Queue**.
**Customization:** Configurable animation speed via a slider.
**Statistics Display:** Real-time display of key metrics, including Current Time, Average Waiting Time, and Average Turnaround Time.
**Export:** Functionality for exporting screenshots of the execution trace.
